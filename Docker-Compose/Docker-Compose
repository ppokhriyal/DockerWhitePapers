Docker-Compose
==============

Compose is a tool for defining and running multi-container Docker applications.With
Compose,we can use YAML file to configure the application's services.Then with a single
command,we can create and start all the services from YAML configuration.

3-step process:

1. Define app's environment with a Dockerfile
2. Define services that make up your app in docker-compose.yml.
3. Run docker-compose up

Compose has commands for managing the whole lifecycle of your application

- Start,Stop and rebuild services
- View the status of running services
- Stream the log output of running services
